                                  Employee Attrition Prediction 

 

Progress 

  CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) was configured for the Flask API. 

  “File corrupted” bug was fixed for excel upload API. 

  Java Spring project was integrated for the back-end of register and login process. 

  A pie chart was designed for the attrition percentage aspect on front-end. 

  Pages of the web application was designed. 

 

 

                               Figure 1: Attrition Levels Visualization 

This figure illustrates a dynamic representation of attrition levels sourced from user-uploaded 

data. The data is processed and depicted both as a pie chart and a corresponding percentage on 

the website. The chart provides a visual breakdown of attrition categories, offering stakeholders 

an accessible and insightful overview of the attrition distribution. 

Works Completed 

  A machine learning model was developed. 

  Flask API was developed. 

  Java Spring API was developed. 

  A front-end template was designed. 

  Front-end was made suitable for usage. 

  APIs were integrated to the front-end. 

 

           

 

                     

 

                        Figure 2: User Registration and Login Interfaces 

This figure encapsulates the user interaction process, featuring both the user registration and 

login interfaces. The registration interface (left) facilitates account creation with a user-friendly 

design, while the login interface (right) provides registered users with secure access to the site. 

Together, these interfaces contribute to an intuitive and accessible user experience. 

 

 

                       

 

                         Figure 4: File Upload Interface for Attrition Data 

This figure illustrates the file upload interface, featuring two distinct boxes allowing users to 

seamlessly upload CSV and Excel files containing attrition data. Users can utilize the browse 

section to search for files with the specified format, either CSV or Excel. The system facilitates 

a straightforward file upload process, enabling users to contribute data effortlessly for further 

analysis. 

Information: The accepted file formats attributes for attrition data are clearly indicated at the 

top of the page. 

 

Works In Progress 

  The machine learning model is being further more optimized to achieve better scores.  

  A details page is being designed for the users. Example file formats for appropriate file 

input and their explanation will be included. 

 

 

              

              Figure 5: Detailed Information Page for File Format Guidance 

This figure presents a screenshot capturing the comprehensive information page detailing file 

format guidelines for uploading attrition data. The page provides users with crucial insights, 

specifying the accepted file types (CSV and Excel), the precise order for entering attributes, 

and specific inputs recommended for various attributes. This detailed guidance ensures users 

have  a  clear  understanding  of  the  required  format,  promoting  accurate  and  efficient  data 

uploads. 

 

 

 

 

Works To Be Done 

  A password pattern will be included in the Java Spring API. 

  Python project will be refactored for a cleaner code. 

  The possible outcomes will be tested manually. 

 

 

 

                      Figure 6: System Verification - Attrition Excel File 

This figure displays of an attrition Excel file used for system verification. The captured image 

serves as a confirmation that the system is processing and handling data correctly. The Excel 

file  showcases  the  organized  structure  of  attrition  data,  reinforcing  the  system's  effective 

functionality in interpreting and managing the provided information.
