The Psycho Krieg and the Very Fantastic Fustercluck story is a wonderful end to the borderlands 3 dlc book line that focuses on a fan favorite character and gives long game lasting players closure on some very big questions of both Krieg â€™ s character and the memorable set in pieces players always interact with.
