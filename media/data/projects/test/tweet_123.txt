Finally played through borderlands 3. The actual game I play is great. Almost all guns feel fun, and yet I never once felt much like someone I seriously needed to grind. That pretty story on the other side hand.... All I will say Is that I'm very damn much so forward looking forward to the eventual endless cutscene skip : )
