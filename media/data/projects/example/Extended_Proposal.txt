CMPE 331 Project Proposal 

2023 Fall 

Objective 

 

 
 

Employee attrition is defined as departure of employees from their organization for 

unpredictable and uncontrollable reasons. This project aims to predict employee attrition 

for a company or an organization within a few months using machine learning algorithms 

, make analysis and give feedback to the human resources of that company or 

organization. The dataset contains several features such as employee’s age, monthly 

income, work-life balance, business travel, years at company etc. 

 

Importance Of The Project 

 

This project is crucial for companies so that human resources can adjust hiring strategies 

and turnovers. Turnover might be costly due to recruitment, training and lost 

productivity. The risk of employees leaving can be identified with this project, allowing 

proactive measures to retain valuable talent and reduce the financial impact of turnovers. 

The project can help identify factors that lead to employee attrition. Understanding these 

factors can enable companies or organizations to implement targeted retention strategies 

such as improving work conditions, offering career development opportunities.
