Employee Attrition Prediction Web Application Project 

 

Introduction to the Project 

In an era where human capital is as crucial as financial assets, the ability to understand and 

manage  employee  turnover  becomes  imperative  for  any  forward-thinking  organization.  The 

project that is embarked upon addresses a fundamental yet often overlooked aspect of corporate 

health - employee attrition. With the evolving dynamics of the modern workplace, companies 

increasingly  seek  reliable  methods  to  not  only  anticipate  but  also  intelligently  respond  to 

workforce  changes.  This  project  steps  into  this  space,  offering  a  data-driven  approach  to 

predicting employee attrition. By harnessing the power of machine learning, a tool is provided 

that is not just reliable for the company in terms of strategic planning and cost management, 

but  also  beneficial  for  employees  in  fostering  a  more  engaging  and  satisfying  work 

environment.  Choosing  to  focus  on  this  problem  reflects  our  commitment  to  enhancing 

organizational resilience and employee well-being, ultimately contributing to a more stable and 

productive workforce. 

 

Objective of the Project 

 

The  phenomenon  of  employee  attrition,  characterized  by  the  unforeseen  departure  of 

employees from an organization, poses a significant challenge in today's corporate landscape. 

This  project  addresses  this  challenge  head-on  by  leveraging  advanced  machine  learning 

algorithms  to  predict  employee  attrition  within  a  few  months.  By  meticulously  analyzing  a 

comprehensive  dataset  encompassing  various  employee  attributes  –  including  age,  monthly 

income, work-life balance, business  travel  frequency, and tenure at  the company  – valuable 

insights  and  actionable  feedback  are  provided  to  the  human  resources  departments  of 

companies and organizations. The aim is to transform this predictive analysis into a strategic 

tool, enhancing the efficacy of workforce management and planning. 

 

 
 

 

 

 
 

Importance of the Project 

 

 

In the complex realm of human resource management, understanding and mitigating employee 

turnover is more than just a tactical move – it's a strategic necessity. This project stands at the 

forefront of this endeavor, offering a crucial advantage for companies in optimizing their hiring 

strategies  and  managing  turnovers.  The  financial  implications  of  employee  attrition  are 

manifold,  encompassing  the  costs  of  recruitment,  training,  and  the  loss  of  productivity.  By 

identifying  the  risk  factors  associated  with  employee  departure,  this  project  empowers 

organizations to take preemptive actions. These actions are not just about retaining talent but 

also about fostering an environment where employees thrive. Through the analysis, companies 

gain  the  ability  to  pinpoint  and  address  the  underlying  causes  of  attrition,  be  it  through 

improving workplace conditions, offering career development opportunities, or other targeted 

retention strategies.  In essence, this project  is  a pivotal  step towards creating a more stable, 

satisfied, and productive workforce.

commitment to making complex data analysis both accessible and insightful for the users. 

 
 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

  Home Page Design 

Figure 1: Home Page  

 

 

 

 

Figure 2: Second Slide of the Home Page 

The first home page of the application (Figure 1) sets the stage for user interaction with a sleek 

and modern design. The central theme revolves around a dark color palette, which not only 

emphasizes the tech-centric nature of the platform but also allows for the vibrant colors of the 

graphics to stand out. The use of abstract and dynamic illustrations signifies the innovative and 

fluid approach that is taken in handling employee attrition. The bold, capitalized typography 

of  the  header  'EMPLOYEE  ATTRITION  PREDICTING'  is  deliberate,  ensuring  immediate 

attention and delivering the site's purpose with clarity. The navigation is made intuitive through 

minimalist arrow buttons, guiding the user seamlessly through the informational content.  

 

 
 

 

 

 
 

 

 

This second page (Figure 2), titled 'WHY EMPALSIS', is designed to communicate the value 

proposition  of  the  service.  It  follows  a  consistent  theme  with  the  home  page  to  maintain  a 

coherent user experience. The 'About Us' call-to-action button is prominently placed against 

the dark background, offering a clear pathway for users seeking more detailed information. The 

design stays faithful to minimalism, reducing distractions and allowing users to focus on the 

message. 

 

 

 

  About Page Design 

 

Figure 3: About Page 

This  page  (Figure  3)  is  an  essential  part  of  any  project,  as  it  establishes  the  ethos  of  the 

company and communicates the core values and mission to the audience. The "About" page is 

designed with clarity and user engagement in mind. It employs a clean and organized layout 

that facilitates easy reading and comprehension. Using a pie chart graphic as a central visual 

metaphor cleverly represents the analytical nature of the services, while human figures actively 

engaging with the chart symbolize the collaborative approach to problem-solving. 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

  Register Page Design  

 

 

 

Figure 4: Register Page 

 

The registration page (Figure 4) of the application is the gateway for new users, designed with 

a focus on simplicity and ease of use. The page features a minimalistic layout that centers on a 

clean  form  against  a  deep  blue  background,  reducing  visual  clutter  and  directing  the  user's 

attention to the task of registration. Fields for the user's name, surname, email, and password 

are laid out  in  a logical  sequence, promoting  a straightforward and undistracted  registration 

process. 

 

  Login Page Design 

 

Figure 5: Login Page 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

The login page (Figure 5) maintains the design continuity of the registration page (Figure 4), 

echoing the same color  palette and simplicity to provide a familiar experience for returning 

users.  It  is  crafted  to  facilitate  quick  and  secure  access,  featuring  only  the  essential  fields 

required for entry: email and password. 

 

 

  Details Page Design 

 Figure 6: Details Page 

This page (Figure 6) serves as an informative guide to ensure users upload their data correctly. 

This  page is  meticulously  designed to  be both  informational and easy to  navigate.  It  begins 

with  a  clear  and  concise  explanation  of  the  accepted  file  formats  and  a  detailed  list  of  the 

attributes required for the dataset in the order they should appear. This is crucial in setting users 

up for success when interfacing with the machine-learning platform. 

 

Directly  beneath  the  textual  instructions,  users  find  an  illustrative  example  in  the  form  of  a 

screenshot  displaying  an  Excel  spreadsheet.  This  visual  example  aligns  precisely  with  the 

specified attributes, providing a real-world reference that users can emulate. The design of this 

page aligns with the overall theme of the application, featuring a clean, straightforward layout 

that prioritizes content comprehension and user guidance. 

The inclusion of an actual Excel format snapshot serves as a practical example, reinforcing the 

textual content and ensuring users have a visual cue to follow. The goal of this page is not only 

to educate but also to reduce the margin of error during the file upload process, which in turn 

streamlines the user experience and enhances the efficiency of the data analysis process. 

 
 

 

 

 

  File Uploading Page Design 

 
 

 

 

 

 

Figure 7: File Uploading Page 

 

This  page  (Figure  7)  is  a  critical  component  of  the  application,  designed  to  facilitate  the 

seamless submission of data files in CSV and Excel formats. This page adheres to a minimalist 

design philosophy, where clarity and ease of use take center stage. The interface is divided into 

two  distinct  sections,  each  dedicated  to  one  of  the  accepted  file  types,  ensuring  users  can 

quickly identify where and how to upload their data. 

The page features prominently labeled areas for 'CSV Upload' and 'Excel Upload,' with dotted 

borders  subtly  indicating  the  drag-and-drop  functionality,  complemented  by  'Browse'  and 

'Upload' buttons. This dual-option layout caters to user preference, accommodating those who 

favor traditional file selection dialogues as well as those who prefer the convenience of drag-

and-drop operations. 

Above the upload areas, we provide concise instructions that reiterate the required format for 

the uploaded files. This ensures users are well-informed of the specifications before initiating 

the upload process, minimizing the potential for errors. 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 
 

 

 

  Successfully Downloaded Page Design 

 

Figure 8: Download Page with Attrition Percentage 

 

This page (Figure 8) is designed to deliver the result of the attrition prediction in a visually 

impactful  and  digestible  manner.  At  the  center  of  the  page  is  a  pie  chart  that  graphically 

represents  the  attrition  percentage,  providing  an  at-a-glance  understanding  of  the  analysis 

outcome. 

 

The  use  of  a  pie  chart  here  is  deliberate;  it  transcends  numerical  data,  offering  an  intuitive 

visual representation of the proportion of employees predicted to leave. The color contrast in 

the chart is thoughtfully chosen to highlight the significant segment, thus drawing immediate 

attention to the critical data point – the attrition risk percentage. 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 
 

Construction of the Project 

Java Spring Back-End : 

Figure 9: Rest Controller 

Figure 9 shows the Rest APIs that is used in Java Spring project that front-end calls. 

Figure 10: Service 

 

 

The methods in figure 10 are the actual logic behind the API which it is called as “Services” 

in MVC design. From the top down, a password pattern is contained so that accounts are 

secured better, there is a registration service that goes to the database after checking the 

constraints and then saves. There is also a login service which goes to the database to validate 

the given inputs. 

 
 

 

 

 
 

Python Flask Back-End: 

Figure 11: Encoding Map and Features

 

 

 

Figure 11 shows that the values of the features in the dataset are encoded to numeric values to 

 

be able to train the model correctly. 

Figure 12: Normalization 

Figure 12 shows the normalization of the dataset. Normalization is the process of scaling 

input features within a similar range (usually between 0 and 1). The goal of the normalization 

 

 
 

 

 

 
 

 

 

is to bring all the features to a similar scale to prevent certain features from dominating and 

having undue influence on the model’s learning process due to differences in their magnitude. 

Figure 13: Feature Selection 

Figure 13 shows the feature selection which is the process of choosing a subset of relevant 

and important features from the original dataset. Three algorithms are involved: Logistic 

Regression, Linear SVC and Decision Tree Classifier. 

Figure 14: Train, Test, Validate and the Machine Learning Model 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

In figure 14, after the feature selection, the dataset is splited into 3 parts: testing data, training 

data and validation data. Different machine learning algorithms are tested, optimized and 

finally the optimal model is found which is the AdaBoost Classifier. Hyperparameters of the 

model are optimized. The training data is fitted, results and scores are taken. 

Figure 15-16: Predicting CSV File Method 

  

Figures 15 and 16 shows the CSV prediction method. The input file, which is a CSV file, is 

encoded to apply the machine learning algorithm and decoded to return back the predicted 

file in understandable format. Employee attrition percentage is also taken and returned.

Figures 18 and 19 shows the Excel prediction method. The input file, which is an Excel file, 

is encoded to apply the machine learning algorithm and decoded to return back the predicted 

file in understandable format. Employee attrition percentage is also taken and returned.

Encountered Challenges 

The biggest problem during the development cycle was the "File corrupted" error response 

while opening the output Excel file. The process for downloading CSV format worked 

successfully while the Excel file didn't, the system gave the mentioned error. The reason 

emerged in the front-end project. The "axios" method has been replaced with the "fetch" 

method and the error cleared away (solely because of the structure of the methods). It turned 

out that it was an encoding problem. Because the CSV file type is text, there is no problem 

with encoding it. But the "axios" method accepts the Excel file as text too when it isn't. The 

"axios" method encodes as UTF-8 when it should be ANSI. But the "fetch" method takes it as 

binary so there is no problem with it. 

 

Test and Results 

 

Figure 23 

The table above shows the test results of the machine learning model. The accuracy is %90. 

In the confusion matrix, there is a total of 294 samples. 266 samples are successfully 

predicted and 28 samples are predicted false. F1 score is %61 which is considered to be 

intermediate reliability. The precision score is %85 and the recall score is %48. Precision is 

the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive 

observations. Recall score is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to actual 

positive observations. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. 

 

 
 

 

 

 
 

 

Future Works 

 

 

Two new pages and functionalities will be added to the application. The first one will keep 

records of previous predictions and display a graph that shows statistics on employee attrition 

levels monthly. With this new functionality, human resources will be able to see past 

attritions and improvements or deteriorations. The second one will keep the predicted 

datasets on the application and display it on the page. Records of these datasets will also be 

kept.
